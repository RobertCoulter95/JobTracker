Job Tracker

This is the api for an application that will be centered around job tracking.
There will be numerous tracking points such as jobs applied to within a certain time frame, 
a breakdown by company as well as others.

This is NOT a job board. 

The first goal is to allow users to create simple jobs for tracking. These will be simple string fields, as well as creating
companies. 

The second goal would be to allow users to post links to a job and have it parsed into a job. This should handle duplicates from the same job board
however duplication due to different job boards with the same job is a future planned feature.
